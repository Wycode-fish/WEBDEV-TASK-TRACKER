TASK TRACKER

Few things to be noted:
1. After logging, if user closes the tab without logging out. The session will be kept. So after user re-log in, user will directly enter the task list without entering index page.
2. By clicking 'Register' on index page, the user will entering form page which requires the user to type in email and name to register.
3. When create new task and assign it to others, users are required to provide the id of the assignee.
4. Assignees should be typed in by their IDs instead of name while creating new tasks.
5. 'Check Available Assignees' will allow users to view the user list but disable the 'New User' function.
6. By cilcking 'SHOW' after a task record, users are allowed to view the detailed info of current task.
7. The rest follows the rules specified on https://bottlenose.ccs.neu.edu/courses/5/assignments/39/submissions/new.
